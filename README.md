# Prediction_Algorithms
This repository contains algorithms that is used to predict a value (here, it's to predict the 5 properties of electrical steel) using various libraries (sklearn, keras and tensorflow).This repository is nothing but the deploying of the algorithms using the libraries. Algorithms used:-

1) Multiple Linear Regression
2) Random Forest
3) Artificial Neural Network
4) Support Vector Machine
5) K-Nearest Neighbours
